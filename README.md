# Criminal History Scraper

Criminal history scraper is a script to scrape the Denver and Colorado state dockets for information about a given criminal Defendant. This is helpful to attorneys practicing criminal law in Denver Municipal Courts and Colorado state courts in general because it provides extensive information regarding a criminal defendant, including failures to appear, sentences for past offenses, and the like. Keep in mind this code will not be helpful to those who don't have access and accounts to the jbits or Denver court databases.
